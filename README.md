## SQL-Joins

### The SQL Joins clause is used to combine records from two or more tables in a database. A JOIN is a means for combining fields from two tables by using values common to each.

###There are different types of joins available in SQL −

INNER JOIN − returns rows when there is a match in both tables.

LEFT JOIN − returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.

RIGHT JOIN − returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table.

FULL JOIN − returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

SELF JOIN − is used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.

CARTESIAN JOIN − returns the Cartesian product of the sets of records from the two or more joined tables.
